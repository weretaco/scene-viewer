<h1>A1: Scene Viewer
<span class="subtitle">by <span class="placeholder">Dmitry Portnoy (dportnoy)</span></span>
</h1>

<p class="placeholder">
Summarize, in about one paragraph, your approach to the scene graph assignment.
How did you structure your code?
What's cool about it? Are there parts you weren't able to complete?
</p>

<h2>My Animation <span class="atag creative">A1-create</span></h2>

<p class="placeholder">
Describe your animation and include a screen recording showing it running in real-time:
</p>

<video>
</video>

<p class="placeholder">
Describe how you created your animation.
</p>

<h2>Using the Scene Viewer</h2>

<p class="placeholder">Provide a short overview of how to use your viewer.</p>

<h3>Command-line Arguments</h3>

<p class="placeholder">
Document the command-line arguments that can be used to control your viewer.
Include both the command-line arguments required by the assignment statement and any additional arguments you decided to add.
</p>

<ul>
<li class="placeholder"><code>--scene <var>scene.s72</var></code> -- required -- load scene from <code><var>scene.s72</var></code></li>
<li class="placeholder">...</li>
</ul>

<h3>Controls</h3>

<p class="placeholder">
Document the keyboard and mouse controls used to control your viewer when run interactively.
Note that the controls below are placeholders not requirements.
</p>

<ul>
<li class="placeholder"><kbd>LMB+Drag</kbd> orbit the camera.</li>
<li class="placeholder"><kbd>F5</kbd> switch to/from the debug camera.</li>
<li class="placeholder">...</li>
</ul>


<h2>My Code</h2>

<p class="placeholder">
For each of the following sections, describe the overall structure of your code, and reference the specific files/functions/data structures that you used.
For any parts that are incomplete, discuss what you were able to do and what you tried but couldn't get working.
</p>

<p class="placeholder">
The purpose of this section is to get you to think critically about your code by explaining it to course staff; these thoughts may help you improve the code as you work on it in A2 and beyond.
This section also forms a road map to your code that we can use while grading.
</p>

<h3>Support Code for Math and Vulkan</h3>

<p class="placeholder">
Cover, at least:
what math (vecr/mat/quat) classes and operations you implemented;
any clever approaches to avoid writing duplicated code for, e.g., <code>vec2</code>, <code>vec3</code>, <code>vec4</code>;
how your code gets a window and a swapchain;
how you decided to handle Vulkan resource creation and destruction (e.g., where do pipelines get created? where do they get destroyed?).
</p>

<h3>Loading scenes, Mesh data <span class="atag">A1-load</span></h3> 

<p class="placeholder">
Cover, at least:
how your viewer stores mesh and scene data;
your approach to parsing JSON.
</p>

<h3>Drawing the scene. <span class="atag">A1-show</span></h3>

<p class="placeholder">
Cover, at least:
how your code computes camera transformations;
how your code get transformation and vertex data to your shaders.
</p>
<p class="placeholder">
Include a screenshot of your viewer drawing an example scene.
</p>

<h3>Handling interactive camera and debug camera movement. <span class="atag">A1-show</span></h3>

<p class="placeholder">
Cover, at least:
what camera controls you decided to implement;
where the camera controls are implemented.
</p>
<p class="placeholder">
Include a screen recording of you moving the camera in a scene.
</p>

<h3>Frustum culling <span class="atag">A1-cull</span></h3>

<p class="placeholder">
Cover, at least:
your culling approach;
what bounding volume you use for meshes and where it is computed.
</p>
<p class="placeholder">
Include a screenshot or recording showing that culling is working (e.g., by using a debug camera to show that meshes outside the user camera's view aren't being drawn).
</p>

<h3>Animating the scene <span class="atag">A1-move</span></h3>

<p class="placeholder">
Cover, at least:
how your viewer stores keyframes;
where your code updates animations;
how your code computes elapsed time (if it isn't running in headless mode!).
</p>

<p class="placeholder">
Include a screen recording showing an animation being played back by your viewer.
</p>

<h3>Handling headless mode <span class="atag">A1-hide</span></h3>

<p class="placeholder">
Cover, at least:
how your code deals with not having a window;
how you deal with getting the timestamps from the events file to (e.g.) animation updates;
any extra events you decided to support.
</p>

<h3>Performance improvements <span class="atag extra">A1x-fast</span></h3>
<p class="placeholder">
Discuss which performance improvements you chose to pursue and how you implemented them.
</p>

<p class="placeholder">
NOTE: you will demonstrate your performance improvements in the next section.
</p>

<h2>Performance Tests</h2>

<p class="placeholder">
This section demonstrates that you have tested your code, including finding its limits.
</p>

<p class="placeholder">
Before getting into the tests, describe here the relevant information about your testing system(s).
(CPU, GPU, Memory, driver versions, OS version, ...  -- anything you think might be relevant!)
</p>

<h3>Culling</h3>
<p class="placeholder">
Demonstrate a scene / camera angle where your culling code improves performance; and demonstrate one where it does not improve performance.
(If you developed more than one culling method, demonstrate the performance gain/loss from each of them in this section.)
</p>

<p class="placeholder">
Use charts to summarize performance and graphs to show overall performance.
Include screenshots of test scenes.
</p>

<h3>Bottlenecks</h3>
<p class="placeholder">
Demonstrate your code bottlenecking on scene traversal (CPU), vertex processing/assembly (GPU), and fragment processing/write-back (GPU).
</p>


<p class="placeholder">
Use graphs to demonstrate sensitivity to test scene complexity.
Include screenshots of test scenes.
</p>

<!-- For example:
<h4>CPU Bottleneck</h4>
<p class="placeholder">
The scenes <a href="#">traversal-*.s72</a> causes my viewer to bottleneck on scene traversal.
This plot shows the ...
</p>
-->

<h3>Performance Improvements</h3>

<p class="placeholder">
For any other performance improvements you attempted, include comparisons showing them working (or not working).
Include screenshots of any test scenes and graphs or charts showing performance differences.
</p>

<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p class="placeholder">
This is the end of the structured report. Feel free to add feedback about A1 (or A0!) to this section.
